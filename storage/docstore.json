Technological\r\nsingularity is also referred to as strong AI or superintelligence. Philosopher Nick\r\nBostrum defines superintelligence as \u201cany intellect that vastly outperforms the best\r\nhuman brains in practically every field, including scientific creativity, general wisdom,\r\nand social skills.\u201d Despite the fact that superintelligence is not imminent in society, the\r\nidea of it raises some interesting questions as we consider the use of autonomous\r\nsystems, like self-driving cars. It\u2019s unrealistic to think that a driverless car would never\r\nhave an accident, but who is responsible and liable under those circumstances? Should\r\nwe still develop autonomous vehicles, or do we limit this technology to\r\nsemi-autonomous vehicles which help people drive safely? The jury is still out on this,\r\nbut these are the types of ethical debates that are occurring as new, innovative AI\r\ntechnology develops.\r\nAI impact on jobs\r\nWhile a lot of public perception of artificial intelligence centers around job losses, this\r\nconcern should probably be reframed. With every disruptive, new technology, we see\r\nthat the market demand for specific job roles shifts. For example, when we look at the\r\nautomotive industry, many manufacturers, like GM, are shifting to focus on electric\r\nvehicle production to align with green initiatives. The energy industry isn\u2019t going away,\r\nbut the source of energy is shifting from a fuel economy to an electric one.\r\nIn a similar way, artificial intelligence will shift the demand for jobs to other areas. There\r\nwill need to be individuals to help manage AI systems. There will still need to be people\r\nto address more complex problems within the industries that are most likely to be\r\naffected by job demand shifts, such as customer service. The biggest challenge with\r\nartificial intelligence and its effect on the job market will be helping people to transition\r\nto new roles that are in demand.\r\nPrivacy\r\nPrivacy tends to be discussed in the context of data privacy, data protection, and data\r\nsecurity.
